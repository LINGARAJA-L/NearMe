            Today i went to the coolest hotel ever! I couldnâ€™t believe what i was seeing, it was amazing! Everything was made out of glass, but that's not all. Every room had some sort of waterfall, river, creek, or body of water in it. When I got off the plane all I wanted to do was go inside. The outside was gorgeous, it was all glass and surrounding the hotel was the pacific ocean .When you walk in you see that the floor is made of glass, the walls are made of glass, the ceiling is made of glass, even the tables and chairs are made of glass. Right beside the front desk is a big waterfall with beautiful blue water pouring out of it, at the end of the waterfall there is a place where you can sit down. The concierge leads you up to your room and you have to walk up these beautiful glass stairs. In my room there was a soft blue rug covering the whole floor but still being able to see the floor was glass underneath. There was a king size bed and on the opposite wall there was a fireplace with a tv on the mantle. I turned and noticed there were two other doors in my room, so I walked into the first door and everything was black. </b>
