                My home is situated in the city. It is not too big nor too small, just the perfect size. My family lives in the home. It comprises of my father, mother, sister and grandparents. We live in our ancestral home so my home is very vintage.

                It is very old but remains to be super strong. There are six rooms in my home. Each family member has a unique room which they have decorated as per their liking. For instance, my elder sister is a big fan of music, so her walls are filled with posters of musicians like BTS, RM, and more.
                
                Our drawing room is a large one with a high ceiling. We still use the vintage sofa set which my grandmother got as a wedding gift. Similarly, there is a vintage TV and radio which she uses till date.
                
                Adjoining the drawing room is my bedroom. It is my favourite room because it contains everything that I love. I have a pet guinea pig which lives in a cage in my room. We also have a storeroom which is filled with things we don’t use but also cannot discard.        </b>

                Badminton is a competitive sport that requires speed, agility and skill on the court. A badminton match consists of the best-of-three games of 21 points. It is a racquet sport in which two or four players hit a shuttlecock back and forth using racquets held crosswise. The shuttlecock is very light.

                Playing badminton is an excellent exercise for the body. It strengthens muscles, enhances reflexes and motor coordination, increases flexibility and improves balance. It helps with these things better than other sports because it uses every muscle in the body.        </b>

            Today i went to the coolest hotel ever! I couldn’t believe what i was seeing, it was amazing! Everything was made out of glass, but that's not all. Every room had some sort of waterfall, river, creek, or body of water in it. When I got off the plane all I wanted to do was go inside. The outside was gorgeous, it was all glass and surrounding the hotel was the pacific ocean .When you walk in you see that the floor is made of glass, the walls are made of glass, the ceiling is made of glass, even the tables and chairs are made of glass. Right beside the front desk is a big waterfall with beautiful blue water pouring out of it, at the end of the waterfall there is a place where you can sit down. The concierge leads you up to your room and you have to walk up these beautiful glass stairs. In my room there was a soft blue rug covering the whole floor but still being able to see the floor was glass underneath. There was a king size bed and on the opposite wall there was a fireplace with a tv on the mantle. I turned and noticed there were two other doors in my room, so I walked into the first door and everything was black. </b>
